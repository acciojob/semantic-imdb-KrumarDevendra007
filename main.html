		The Straw Hat Pirates leave for the island of Elegia to attend a concert by Uta, a world-famous singer. After Uta performs her first song ("New Genesis"), Monkey D. Luffy goes on stage to reunite with her, revealing that the two of them know each other because Uta is the adopted daughter of "Red-Haired" Shanks. They met when Shanks was based at Luffy's hometown 12 years ago, but one day he returned from a voyage without her, claiming she had left to pursue a career as a singer.
